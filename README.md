# Fair K-Means

Fair K-Means produces a fair clustering assignment according to the fairness definition of Chierichetti et al. [1]. Each point has a binary color assigned to it. The goal is to assign the points to clusters such that the number of points with different colors in each cluster is the same. The algorithm also works with weights, so each point can participate with a different weight in the coloring. 

The algorithm works as follows, assuming that the binary colors are red and blue:
1. A matching between the red and blue points is computed such that the cost (the point distances) of the matching is minimized.
2. The mean of each matched pair is computed.
3. A K-Means++ clustering of all the means is computed, and the point pairs are assigned to the clusters of their means.

## Installation

```bash
pip install fair-kmeans
```

## Example

```python
from fair_kmeans import FairKMeans

example_data = [
    [1.0, 1.0, 1.0],
    [1.1, 1.1, 1.1],
    [1.2, 1.2, 1.2],
    [2.0, 2.0, 2.0],
    [2.1, 2.1, 2.1],
    [2.2, 2.2, 2.2],
]

example_colors = [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

km = FairKMeans(n_clusters=2, random_state=0)
km.fit(example_data, color=example_colors)
labels = km.labels_
centers = km.cluster_centers_

print(labels) # [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
print(centers) # [[1.65, 1.65, 1.65], [1.5, 1.5, 1.5]]
```

## Example with Weights

```python
from fair_kmeans import FairKMeans

example_data = [
    [1.0, 1.0, 1.0],
    [1.1, 1.1, 1.1],
    [1.2, 1.2, 1.2],
    [2.0, 2.0, 2.0],
    [2.1, 2.1, 2.1],
    [2.2, 2.2, 2.2],
]

example_colors = [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
example_weights = [2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3]

km = FairKMeans(n_clusters=2, random_state=0)
km.fit(example_data, color=example_colors, sample_weight=example_weights)
labels = km.labels_
centers = km.cluster_centers_

print(labels) # [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0]
print(centers) # [[0.85, 0.85, 0.85], [1.28, 1.28, 1.28]]
```

## Development

Install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)
```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

Install clang
```bash
sudo apt-get install clang
```

Set clang variables
```bash
export CXX=/usr/bin/clang++
export CC=/usr/bin/clang
```

Install the package
```bash
poetry install
```

If the installation does not work and you do not see the C++ output, you can build the package to see the stack trace
```bash
poetry build
```

Run the tests
```bash
poetry run python -m unittest discover tests -v
```
